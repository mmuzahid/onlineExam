==========
## A web-based MCQ exam application. 

This application developed using technologies like Play-1.2.5(JavaEE framework), MySQL, Bootstrap etc.

**N.B.** I copied few code for Login module, Access Control module from my previous company where I worked for long time to make development faster. Before copying I consulted with my supervisors.
Other features like Exam module, QuestionSet Manage, AnswerScript module, Report module etc are fully developed by me.
