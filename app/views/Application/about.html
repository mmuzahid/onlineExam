    	<p>Today, Information Technological advancement has minimized the whole world. <strong>&{'application.name'}</strong> is an application that allows conducting examination through web. Goal of this project is to provide quick, immediate and easy way to appear the exam and reducing usage of pen and paper. This application allow us to arrange a MCQ (multiple choice question) examination thorough Internet. By signing in the system we can create our own exams, can search existing exams and can participate to those exams. This application supports both single and multiple answered questions. Exam author who created that exam can also configure some important features such as question set is random or fixed, exam validation period in which exam will be activated etc. We can search exam by some keyword like author name, exam title, and exam code. After searching we can start an exam by clicking start button. Then System provides participants an interface almost same as real world MCQ answer paper with questions. Participants fill the answer paper up and submit it to the server by clicking submit test button. After receiving submitted answers system calculates the result and responses result to the participant with correct answer. Participates can view their attended exam results and also able to ask any inquiry about the question. Exam author also can view a summarized report to observe the result status of the exam. Another user of this system is Administrator who has the authorization to manipulate user information and also some exam information.

    Although I have tried to add minimum basic features of <strong>&{'application.name'}</strong> but It will be more fruitful if following features are added to current one: 
	<ul>
		<li>Author of exam can't hide exam from out world. So we can add a visibility feature like public or private accessibility of exam.</li> 
		<li>No time limit for completing exam. So we can add time limit of exam.</li>
		<li>We can't set mark for each question and negative mark for work answer. So this feature is a very demandable future scope.</li>
		<li>No notification features for new comments or exam submissions. So we can add a notification feature to provide more interactive user experience.</li>
